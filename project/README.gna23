- Designed and implemented the data pipeline to dynamically generate augmented images and ground truths in `train2.py`.
- Implemented the training code for the new model along with the new training procedure in `ft0.py`.
- Optimized the training process by integrating efficient data loading techniques, reducing runtime.
